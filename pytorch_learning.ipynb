    "\n",
    "- **Device** refers to where tensors live: CPU or GPU (CUDA)\n",
    "- Use `torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')` to automatically select the best device\n",
    "- Create tensors on a device with `device=` parameter: `torch.tensor([1, 2], device=device)`\n",
    "- Move tensors with `.to(device)`, `.cuda()`, or `.cpu()` methods\n",
    "- **Critical rule**: All tensors in an operation must be on the same device\n",
    "- GPUs provide massive speedups (10-100x) for large tensor operations\n",
    "- Move results to CPU with `.cpu()` before converting to NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. Set your device once at the start: `device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')`\n",
    "2. Move models and data to device immediately after creation\n",
    "3. Keep tensors on GPU during training, only move to CPU when needed\n",
    "4. Use `.to(device)` instead of `.cuda()` for code that works on both CPU and GPU\n",

    "## Dimension Arguments - Specifying Axes for Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are dimension arguments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many PyTorch operations (like sum, mean, max) can work across specific dimensions (axes) of a tensor. The dimension argument (often called `dim` or `axis`) tells PyTorch which dimension to operate along. Think of it as choosing which direction to \"collapse\" the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do dimension arguments matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, you constantly need to perform operations along specific dimensions:\n",
    "- **Batch processing**: Average loss across all samples in a batch (dim=0)\n",
    "- **Sequence operations**: Sum values across time steps (dim=1)\n",
    "- **Feature aggregation**: Find maximum activation across feature channels (dim=-1)\n",
    "- **Attention mechanisms**: Compute softmax over sequence length dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding dimensions is crucial because:\n",
    "- It controls how data is aggregated or transformed\n",
    "- Wrong dimension = wrong results (and often hard-to-debug errors!)\n",
    "- Many neural network operations depend on dimension-specific computations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension indexing**:\n",
    "- Dimensions are **zero-indexed**: first dimension is 0, second is 1, etc.\n",
    "- **Negative indexing** works too: -1 is the last dimension, -2 is second-to-last\n",
    "- For a 2D tensor (matrix): dim=0 is rows, dim=1 is columns\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension Arguments:**\n",
    "- The `dim` parameter specifies which dimension to operate along\n",
    "- Dimensions are zero-indexed: 0, 1, 2, ...\n",
    "- Negative indexing works: -1 (last), -2 (second-to-last), etc.\n",
    "- Operations like `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()` support dimension arguments\n",
    "- Without `dim`, operations work on ALL elements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "- `dim=0`: Operate across the batch (aggregate samples)\n",
    "- `dim=1`: Operate across sequences/rows\n",
    "- `dim=-1`: Operate across the last dimension (often features)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The keepdim Parameter:**\n",
    "- `keepdim=False` (default): Removes the dimension being operated on\n",
    "- `keepdim=True`: Keeps the dimension with size 1\n",
    "- Use `keepdim=True` when you need to broadcast operations back to the original shape\n",
    "- Essential for normalization operations (mean normalization, batch norm, layer norm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Applications:**\n",
    "- Computing batch statistics: `batch.mean(dim=0)`\n",
    "- Aggregating sequences: `sequence.sum(dim=1)`\n",
    "- Normalizing features: `(x - x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)) / x.std(dim=-1, keepdim=True)`\n",
    "- Finding maximum activations: `activations.max(dim=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding dimension arguments is fundamental to working with multi-dimensional data in PyTorch. They give you precise control over how operations aggregate or transform your tensors!"

    "\n",
    "**What is matrix multiplication?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is a fundamental linear algebra operation that combines two matrices to produce a new matrix. Unlike element-wise multiplication (where you multiply corresponding elements), matrix multiplication follows specific rules:\n",
    "- The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix\n",
    "- The result has the shape (rows of first matrix, columns of second matrix)\n",
    "- Each element in the result is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does matrix multiplication matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is **the core operation** in neural networks:\n",
    "- **Linear layers**: Transform inputs via weight matrices: `output = input @ weights + bias`\n",
    "- **Attention mechanisms**: Compute query-key interactions in transformers\n",
    "- **Convolutions**: Can be expressed as matrix multiplications\n",
    "- **Batch processing**: Efficiently process multiple samples simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "Every forward pass through a neural network involves dozens or hundreds of matrix multiplications. Understanding this operation is essential for understanding how neural networks work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch provides three ways to do matrix multiplication:**\n",
    "1. `torch.mm()` - Basic matrix multiplication (2D only)\n",
    "2. `torch.matmul()` - General matrix multiplication (supports broadcasting)\n",
    "3. `@` operator - Pythonic syntax for matmul (recommended)\n",

    "3. **`A @ B`** - Pythonic operator, equivalent to matmul (recommended!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape Rules:**\n",
    "- For 2D: `(m, n) @ (n, p) = (m, p)` - inner dimensions must match\n",
    "- For batches: `(batch, m, n) @ (batch, n, p) = (batch, m, p)`\n",
    "- Broadcasting: `(batch, m, n) @ (n, p) = (batch, m, p)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Cases:**\n",
    "- Vector @ Matrix: `(n,) @ (n, m) = (m,)` - produces a vector\n",
    "- Matrix @ Vector: `(m, n) @ (n,) = (m,)` - produces a vector\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Reduction Operations:**\n",
    "- **`sum()`** - Add all elements together\n",
    "- **`mean()`** - Compute average value\n",
    "- **`max()`** - Find maximum value (returns values and indices when used with dim)\n",
    "- **`min()`** - Find minimum value (returns values and indices when used with dim)\n",
    "- **`std()`** - Compute standard deviation\n",
    "- **`var()`** - Compute variance\n",
    "- **`prod()`** - Multiply all elements together\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Patterns:**\n",
    "- **No dimension**: Reduce entire tensor to a single value\n",
    "- **With dimension**: Reduce along specific dimension(s)\n",
    "- **keepdim=True**: Preserve dimension with size 1 for broadcasting\n",
    "- **Multiple dimensions**: `tensor.mean(dim=(0, 1))` reduces multiple dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Reductions:**\n",
    "1. **Loss computation**: Average loss across batch → `losses.mean()`\n",
    "2. **Normalization**: Compute statistics → `data.mean(dim=0)`, `data.std(dim=0)`\n",
    "3. **Pooling**: Reduce spatial dimensions → `features.max(dim=2)`\n",
    "4. **Metrics**: Calculate accuracy, precision → `(pred == target).float().mean()`\n",
    "5. **Feature aggregation**: Summarize information → `embeddings.mean(dim=1)`\n",
    "6. **Finding extremes**: Get max/min activations → `activations.max(dim=-1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- `max()` and `min()` with dimension return **both values and indices**\n",
    "- Use `.values` and `.indices` to access them separately\n",
    "- For boolean tensors, `sum()` counts True values\n",
    "- `mean()` requires float tensors (convert with `.float()` if needed)\n",
    "- Multiple dimensions can be reduced at once: `dim=(0, 1, 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning Applications:**\n",
    "- Every training step uses `loss.mean()` to get a scalar for backpropagation\n",
    "- Batch normalization uses `mean()` and `std()` across the batch dimension\n",
    "- Max pooling uses `max()` to downsample feature maps\n",
    "- Global average pooling uses `mean()` to reduce spatial dimensions\n",
    "- Accuracy computation uses `sum()` to count correct predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction operations are fundamental tools for aggregating and summarizing tensor data. Master these operations, and you'll be able to compute statistics, normalize data, and implement custom loss functions and metrics with ease!"

    "**What Argmax Does:**\n",
    "- Returns the **index** of the maximum value, not the value itself\n",
    "- `torch.argmax(tensor)` - Find global maximum index\n",
    "- `torch.argmax(tensor, dim=d)` - Find maximum index along dimension d\n",
    "- If multiple maxima exist, returns the **first** occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Usage Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Classification predictions**: `predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)`\n",
    "- **Accuracy computation**: `correct = (predictions == labels).float().mean()`\n",
    "- **Sequence labeling**: `token_classes = torch.argmax(scores, dim=-1)`\n",
    "- **Attention mechanisms**: Find positions with highest attention\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Facts:**\n",
    "- Argmax on logits = Argmax on probabilities (softmax preserves order)\n",
    "- Only compute softmax when you need actual probability values\n",
    "- For top-K predictions, use `torch.topk()` instead\n",
    "- Argmax returns indices as **long** (int64) tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension Guidelines:**\n",
    "- **No dim**: Returns single index (flattened tensor)\n",
    "- **dim=1** (most common): Predict class for each sample in batch\n",
    "- **dim=-1**: Operate on last dimension (works for any number of dimensions)\n",
    "- **dim=0**: Find best sample for each class (less common)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "1. **Image Classification**: Convert model outputs to predicted class labels\n",
    "2. **Text Classification**: Determine sentiment, topic, or intent\n",
    "3. **Object Detection**: Select highest confidence bounding boxes\n",
    "4. **Sequence Labeling**: Predict tags for each token (NER, POS tagging)\n",
    "5. **Recommendation Systems**: Select top-ranked items\n",
    "6. **Reinforcement Learning**: Choose action with highest Q-value\n",

    "**Argmax vs Max:**\n",
    "- `max()` returns the maximum **value**\n",
    "- `argmax()` returns the **index** of the maximum value\n",

Every time you see a model make a prediction, argmax is working behind the scenes to convert continuous scores into discrete class labels.

    "**What is a computation graph?**\n",

    "A computation graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that PyTorch automatically builds to track all operations performed on tensors with `requires_grad=True`. Each node in the graph represents:\n",
    "- **Tensors** (data): The inputs, intermediate values, and outputs\n",
    "- **Operations** (functions): The mathematical operations applied (add, multiply, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The computation graph is the foundation of automatic differentiation:\n",
    "- **Automatic gradients**: PyTorch uses the graph to compute derivatives automatically\n",
    "- **Backpropagation**: Gradients flow backward through the graph from output to inputs\n",
    "- **Dynamic**: The graph is built on-the-fly during the forward pass\n",
    "- **Memory efficient**: PyTorch can free intermediate values after backward pass\n",

    "**What is a Computation Graph?**\n",
    "- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) tracking all operations on tensors\n",
    "- Nodes represent tensors and operations\n",
    "- Edges represent data flow from inputs to outputs\n",
    "- Built automatically during the forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Attributes:**\n",
    "- **`grad_fn`**: Points to the function that created a tensor\n",
    "- **`is_leaf`**: True for input tensors, False for intermediate results\n",
    "- **`next_functions`**: Links to previous operations in the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Graphs:**\n",
    "- Built on-the-fly during execution (define-by-run)\n",
    "- Can change structure based on input or conditions\n",
    "- Allows natural Python control flow (if/else, loops)\n",
    "- Makes debugging easier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Lifecycle:**\n",
    "1. **Forward pass**: Graph is built as operations execute\n",
    "2. **Backward pass**: Gradients computed by traversing graph backward\n",
    "3. **After backward**: Graph is freed to save memory (unless `retain_graph=True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- The computation graph is how PyTorch implements automatic differentiation\n",
    "- Understanding it helps you debug gradient issues\n",
    "- It explains why you can't backward twice without `retain_graph=True`\n",
    "- It's the foundation for training neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Training:**\n",
    "Every time you do a forward pass through a neural network, PyTorch builds a computation graph. When you call `loss.backward()`, PyTorch traverses this graph to compute gradients for all parameters. This is the magic that makes training neural networks possible!\n",

    "- Handle multiple inputs (partial derivatives)\n",
    "- Work with vectors and matrices\n",
    "- Apply chain rule through arbitrarily deep compositions\n",

    "\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The .grad Attribute:**\n",
    "- Stores computed gradients after `.backward()`\n",
    "- Has the same shape as the tensor\n",
    "- Initially `None` before any backward pass\n",
    "- Only retained for leaf tensors by default\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Accumulation:**\n",
    "- Gradients **accumulate** (add up) by default\n",
    "- Calling `.backward()` multiple times adds to existing gradients\n",
    "- This is usually NOT what you want in training\n",
    "- Must zero gradients between training steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zeroing Gradients:**\n",
    "- Use `tensor.grad.zero_()` to zero gradients in-place\n",
    "- Or set `tensor.grad = None` (slightly more efficient)\n",
    "- Optimizers provide `.zero_grad()` to zero all parameter gradients\n",
    "- **Critical**: Always zero gradients before each training step!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leaf vs Non-Leaf Tensors:**\n",
    "- **Leaf tensors**: Created by user, gradients retained\n",
    "- **Non-leaf tensors**: Created by operations, gradients NOT retained (saves memory)\n",
    "- Use `.retain_grad()` to keep gradients for non-leaf tensors (debugging)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Typical training step\n",
    "optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero gradients\n",
    "output = model(input)  # Forward pass\n",
    "loss = criterion(output, target)  # Compute loss\n",
    "loss.backward()  # Compute gradients (stored in .grad)\n",
    "optimizer.step()  # Update parameters using .grad\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "- Forgetting to zero gradients → gradients accumulate → wrong updates\n",
    "- Trying to access `.grad` before calling `.backward()` → None\n",
    "- Expecting gradients for non-leaf tensors → None (use `.retain_grad()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "The `.grad` attribute is the bridge between autograd and optimization. Autograd computes gradients and stores them in `.grad`. Optimizers read `.grad` to update parameters. Understanding gradient attributes is essential for:\n",
    "- Implementing training loops correctly\n",
    "- Debugging gradient issues\n",
    "- Implementing custom optimization algorithms\n",
    "- Understanding how PyTorch training works under the hood\n",

    "**What is the backward pass?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward pass is the process of computing gradients by traversing the computation graph from output to inputs. In PyTorch, you trigger the backward pass by calling `.backward()` on a scalar tensor (usually the loss). PyTorch then uses backpropagation to compute gradients for all tensors that have `requires_grad=True`.\n",

    "- **Backpropagation**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm efficiently\n",
    "- **Chain rule**: Applies the chain rule automatically through the entire network\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Provides gradients to optimizers for parameter updates\n",

    "1. **Forward pass**: Compute predictions and loss\n",
    "2. **Backward pass**: Compute gradients via backpropagation\n",

    "- Calling `.backward()` specifically on the loss tensor\n",
    "- Computes gradients for all model parameters\n",
    "- The single most important line in neural network training\n",
    "- Implements backpropagation through the entire network\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Training Pattern:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer.zero_grad()        # 1. Clear old gradients\n",
    "output = model(input)        # 2. Forward pass\n",
    "loss = criterion(output, target)  # 3. Compute loss\n",
    "loss.backward()              # 4. Compute gradients ← THE KEY STEP\n",
    "optimizer.step()             # 5. Update parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What loss.backward() Does:**\n",
    "1. Starts at the loss (a scalar value)\n",
    "2. Traverses the computation graph backward\n",
    "3. Applies chain rule at each operation\n",
    "4. Computes gradients for all parameters\n",
    "5. Stores gradients in `.grad` attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "- **Learning**: Gradients tell the model how to improve\n",
    "- **Direction**: Gradients show which way to adjust parameters\n",
    "- **Magnitude**: Gradient size indicates how much to adjust\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Enables gradient-based optimization algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Works With Any Loss:**\n",
    "- Classification: CrossEntropyLoss, BCELoss, etc.\n",
    "- Regression: MSELoss, L1Loss, etc.\n",
    "- Custom: Any differentiable function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Basic training**: One forward, one backward per batch\n",
    "- **Gradient accumulation**: Multiple forwards, one backward (large batches)\n",
    "- **Mixed precision**: Scaled backward for memory efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Rules:**\n",
    "- Loss must be a scalar (single value)\n",
    "- Always zero gradients before backward\n",
    "- Call backward before optimizer.step()\n",
    "- Graph is freed after backward (unless retain_graph=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Big Picture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network training is a cycle:\n",
    "1. **Forward pass**: Model makes predictions\n",
    "2. **Loss computation**: Measure how wrong predictions are\n",
    "3. **loss.backward()**: Figure out how to improve ← YOU ARE HERE\n",
    "4. **Optimizer step**: Actually improve the model\n",
    "5. Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `loss.backward()`, the model would never learn. It's the moment where:\n",
    "- The model analyzes its mistakes\n",
    "- Figures out how each parameter contributed to the error\n",
    "- Computes exactly how to adjust parameters to do better\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: `loss.backward()` is where the magic happens. It's the implementation of backpropagation - the algorithm that revolutionized machine learning and made deep learning possible. Every time you train a neural network, `loss.backward()` is working behind the scenes to make your model smarter!\n",

    "`nn.Module` is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. Every neural network you build - from simple linear layers to complex transformers - inherits from `nn.Module`. It's the fundamental building block that makes PyTorch's neural network API so powerful and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `nn.Module` as a container that:\n",
    "- Holds learnable parameters (weights and biases)\n",
    "- Defines how data flows through the network (forward pass)\n",
    "- Automatically tracks all parameters for optimization\n",
    "- Provides utilities for training, evaluation, and device management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does nn.Module matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "nn.Module is **essential** for building neural networks because it:\n",
    "- **Automatic parameter tracking**: Registers all parameters automatically\n",
    "- **Composability**: Modules can contain other modules (layers within networks)\n",
    "- **Device management**: Easy movement between CPU and GPU\n",
    "- **Training modes**: Handles train vs eval behavior (dropout, batch norm)\n",
    "- **State management**: Save and load model weights easily\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key principle**: Every neural network component is an nn.Module - individual layers (Linear, Conv2d), activation functions (ReLU), and complete models (ResNet, BERT) all inherit from nn.Module.\n",

    "        return self.layer(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Methods:**\n",
    "- `__init__()`: Initialize layers and parameters\n",
    "- `forward(x)`: Define how data flows through the module\n",
    "- `.parameters()`: Get all learnable parameters\n",
    "- `.to(device)`: Move module to CPU/GPU\n",
    "- `.train()`: Set to training mode\n",
    "- `.eval()`: Set to evaluation mode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Rules:**\n",
    "1. Always call `super().__init__()` first in `__init__()`\n",
    "2. Call the module like a function: `output = model(input)`, not `model.forward(input)`\n",
    "3. Define all layers in `__init__()`, use them in `forward()`\n",
    "4. Use `model.train()` during training, `model.eval()` during inference\n",
    "5. Move model to device before creating optimizer: `model.to(device)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Custom modules**: For complex architectures with custom logic\n",
    "- **nn.Sequential**: For simple sequential layer stacks\n",

    "- Automatically tracked by nn.Module\n",
    "- Updated by optimizers during training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter vs Regular Tensor:**\n",
    "- **Regular tensor**: Just data, not tracked, not optimized\n",
    "- **nn.Parameter**: Tracked by module, included in `.parameters()`, optimized\n",
    "- **Rule**: Use nn.Parameter for any tensor you want to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Parameter Operations:**\n",
    "- **Access**: `model.layer.weight`, `model.layer.bias`\n",
    "- **List all**: `model.parameters()` or `model.named_parameters()`\n",
    "- **Count**: `sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())`\n",
    "- **Freeze**: `param.requires_grad = False`\n",
    "- **Unfreeze**: `param.requires_grad = True`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Initialization:**\n",
    "- **Default**: PyTorch uses sensible defaults (usually uniform or normal)\n",
    "- **Xavier/Glorot**: Good for tanh/sigmoid activations\n",
    "- **Kaiming/He**: Good for ReLU activations\n",
    "- **Custom**: Use `torch.nn.init` module for custom initialization\n",

    "**Advanced Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Freezing**: Prevent parameters from updating (transfer learning)\n",
    "- **Sharing**: Reuse same parameters in multiple places\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add penalties to parameter values (L1, L2)\n",
    "- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary parameters to reduce model size\n",

    "**What are Weights?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights are the **connection strengths** between neurons in a neural network. In a linear layer, the weight matrix defines how input features are combined to produce output features. Each weight value represents how strongly one input feature influences one output feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of weights as:\n",
    "- **Amplifiers**: Large weights amplify signals\n",
    "- **Filters**: Weights select which inputs matter\n",

    "- **Feature extraction**: Weights transform raw inputs into useful representations\n",
    "- **Decision making**: Weights determine how inputs map to outputs\n",
    "- **Model capacity**: More weights = more complex patterns the model can learn\n",

    "\n",
    "**What are Bias Parameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias parameters are **offset terms** added to the weighted sum in neural network layers. While weights determine how inputs are combined, biases shift the output up or down. In a linear layer, the computation is: `output = input @ weight + bias`\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of bias as:\n",
    "- **Baseline activation**: The output when all inputs are zero\n",
    "- **Threshold adjuster**: Shifts the activation threshold\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Allows the model to fit data that doesn't pass through the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do Bias Parameters matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Biases are **essential for model flexibility**:\n",
    "- **Non-zero intercepts**: Without bias, all functions must pass through zero\n",
    "- **Activation control**: Bias determines when neurons activate\n",
    "- **Better fitting**: Bias allows models to fit a wider range of patterns\n",
    "- **Convergence**: Proper bias initialization can speed up training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: To learn `y = 2x + 3`, you need:\n",
    "- Weight = 2 (the slope)\n",
    "- Bias = 3 (the intercept)\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Bias?**\n",
    "- Offset term added to weighted sum: `output = input @ weight + bias`\n",
    "- One bias value per output feature\n",
    "- Learnable parameter, updated during training\n",
    "- The output value when all inputs are zero\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Bias Matters:**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Allows functions that don't pass through origin\n",
    "- **Intercept**: Provides the y-intercept in linear functions\n",
    "- **Threshold**: Controls when neurons activate\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Learns baseline predictions for imbalanced data\n",
    "\n",
    "**With vs Without Bias:**\n",
    "- **With bias**: `y = wx + b` (any line)\n",
    "- **Without bias**: `y = wx` (line through origin)\n",
    "- **Default**: Always use bias unless you have a specific reason not to\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Skip Bias:**\n",
    "- After batch normalization or layer normalization\n",
    "- When function naturally passes through origin\n",
    "- To reduce parameters in very large models\n",
    "- Specific architectural requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias Initialization:**\n",
    "- **Zero**: Most common, let model learn from scratch\n",
    "- **Small constant**: For specific activations (e.g., 0.01 for ReLU)\n",
    "- **Custom**: Based on domain knowledge or data statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias in Training:**\n",
    "- Learned alongside weights via backpropagation\n",
    "- Typically converges faster than weights\n",
    "- Can indicate data properties (e.g., class imbalance)\n",
    "- Monitored during training for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Standard layer with bias (default)\n",
    "nn.Linear(10, 5, bias=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Layer without bias (before normalization)\n",
    "nn.Linear(10, 5, bias=False)\n",
    "nn.BatchNorm1d(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize bias to zero\n",
    "layer = nn.Linear(10, 5)\n",
    "nn.init.zeros_(layer.bias)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Big Picture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias parameters are the **baseline** or **default** behavior of neurons:\n",
    "- **Weights** determine how inputs affect outputs\n",
    "- **Bias** determines the output when inputs are neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, weights and bias give neural networks the flexibility to learn any linear transformation. Without bias, you'd be missing half the picture!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: In `y = wx + b`:\n",
    "- `w` (weight) is the slope - how much y changes with x\n",
    "- `b` (bias) is the intercept - where the line crosses the y-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are essential for learning general functions!"

    "\n",
    "**What are activation functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions are non-linear transformations applied to the outputs of neural network layers. They take a number (or tensor of numbers) as input and transform it according to a specific mathematical function. Without activation functions, neural networks would just be a series of linear transformations, which can only learn linear relationships - no matter how many layers you stack!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do activation functions matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions are **essential** for neural networks to learn complex patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enable non-linearity**: They allow networks to learn non-linear relationships in data\n",
    "2. **Create decision boundaries**: Help networks separate different classes in classification tasks\n",
    "3. **Control gradient flow**: Affect how gradients propagate during backpropagation\n",
    "4. **Introduce sparsity**: Some activations (like ReLU) can zero out neurons, creating sparse representations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Universal Approximation Theorem** states that a neural network with at least one hidden layer and a non-linear activation function can approximate any continuous function. Without activation functions, this wouldn't be possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common activation functions in deep learning:**\n",
    "- **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): Most popular, simple and effective\n",
    "- **GeLU** (Gaussian Error Linear Unit): Smooth alternative to ReLU, used in transformers\n",
    "- **Softmax**: Converts logits to probabilities for classification\n",
    "- **Sigmoid**: Squashes values to (0, 1), used for binary classification\n",
    "- **Tanh**: Squashes values to (-1, 1), centered at zero\n",

    "\n",
    "GeLU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) is a smooth activation function that has become popular in modern architectures, especially transformers (like BERT and GPT). The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GeLU(x) = x * Φ(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Φ(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution. In simpler terms, GeLU weights inputs by their value, with a smooth transition around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: GeLU can be thought of as a smooth version of ReLU. Instead of abruptly cutting off at zero, it smoothly transitions from negative to positive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does GeLU matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smooth gradients**: Unlike ReLU's sharp corner at zero, GeLU is smooth everywhere\n",
    "2. **Better performance**: Often outperforms ReLU in transformer architectures\n",
    "3. **Stochastic regularization**: Can be interpreted as applying dropout that depends on the input\n",
    "4. **Non-monotonic**: Unlike ReLU, GeLU can output small negative values for negative inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use GeLU:**\n",
    "- Transformer models (BERT, GPT, etc.)\n",
    "- Modern NLP architectures\n",

    "- **Advantages**: Smooth gradients, often better performance, allows small negative values\n",

    "### Softmax - Converting Logits to Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Softmax?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax is a special activation function that converts a vector of numbers (called logits) into a probability distribution. The formula for each element is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Softmax(xi) = exp(xi) / Σ exp(xj)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "1. Take the exponential of each element\n",
    "2. Divide each by the sum of all exponentials\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties of Softmax output:**\n",
    "- All values are between 0 and 1\n",
    "- All values sum to exactly 1\n",
    "- Larger inputs get larger probabilities\n",
    "- It's a \"soft\" version of argmax (hence the name)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does Softmax matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax is **essential for multi-class classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Produces probabilities**: Converts raw scores to interpretable probabilities\n",
    "2. **Mutually exclusive classes**: Perfect for \"pick one class\" problems\n",
    "3. **Differentiable**: Unlike argmax, softmax has gradients for training\n",
    "4. **Amplifies differences**: Larger logits get exponentially larger probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Softmax:**\n",
    "- **Output layer** of multi-class classification networks\n",
    "- Attention mechanisms in transformers\n",
    "- Any time you need to convert scores to probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Softmax is typically used ONLY in the output layer, not in hidden layers!\n",

    "\n",
    "Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique that normalizes activations across the feature dimension for each sample independently. For each sample, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computes the mean and standard deviation across all features\n",
    "2. Normalizes to have mean=0 and std=1\n",
    "3. Applies learned scale (γ) and shift (β) parameters\n",

    "- σ = standard deviation across features\n",
    "- γ, β = learnable parameters\n",

    "**Why does LayerNorm matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "LayerNorm is **essential** for training deep networks, especially transformers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training stability**: Prevents activations from exploding or vanishing\n",
    "2. **Faster convergence**: Networks train faster with normalized activations\n",
    "3. **Reduces internal covariate shift**: Stabilizes the distribution of layer inputs\n",

    "- **Benefits**: Training stability, faster convergence, works with any batch size\n",
    "- **Standard in transformers**: Used in BERT, GPT, and all modern NLP models\n",

    "## Dropout - Regularization Through Random Deactivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Dropout?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly \"drops out\" (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons during training. For each training step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly select a fraction `p` of neurons to drop\n",
    "2. Set their outputs to zero\n",
    "3. Scale the remaining outputs by 1/(1-p) to maintain expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "During inference (evaluation), dropout is turned off - all neurons are active.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does Dropout matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is one of the most effective regularization techniques in deep learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prevents overfitting**: Forces the network to not rely on any single neuron\n",
    "2. **Ensemble effect**: Training with dropout is like training many sub-networks\n",
    "3. **Improves generalization**: Models perform better on unseen data\n",
    "4. **Simple to implement**: Just add `nn.Dropout()` layers\n",
    "5. **Widely used**: Standard in most deep learning architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Dropout:**\n",
    "- After fully connected layers (common: p=0.5)\n",
    "- After convolutional layers (common: p=0.2-0.3)\n",
    "- In transformer feedforward layers\n",
    "- When your model is overfitting (training accuracy >> validation accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to use Dropout:**\n",
    "- In very small networks (may hurt performance)\n",
    "- When you have very little data (other regularization may be better)\n",
    "- In the output layer\n",

    "- **Parameter p**: Probability of dropping a neuron (common: 0.3-0.5)\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Remaining activations are scaled by 1/(1-p) during training\n",

    "**Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions applied to neuron outputs that enable neural networks to learn complex patterns. Without activation functions, stacking multiple layers would be equivalent to a single linear transformation. Common examples include ReLU, GeLU, and Softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adam Optimizer**: An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp. Adam computes individual learning rates for each parameter and is widely used because it works well with minimal tuning. It maintains moving averages of both gradients and squared gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argmax**: An operation that returns the index (position) of the maximum value in a tensor. In classification tasks, argmax is used to convert model probabilities into predicted class labels. For example, if a model outputs [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], argmax returns 1 (the index of 0.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autograd**: PyTorch's automatic differentiation system that automatically computes gradients for tensor operations. Autograd builds a computation graph as you perform operations, then uses the chain rule to compute derivatives during backpropagation. This eliminates the need to manually calculate gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward Pass**: The process of computing gradients by propagating errors backward through the network, from output to input. During the backward pass, PyTorch uses the chain rule to calculate how much each parameter contributed to the loss. This is triggered by calling `.backward()` on a loss tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias Parameters**: Learnable offset terms added to layer outputs that allow the model to shift activation functions. In a linear layer computing `y = Wx + b`, the bias `b` lets the model learn patterns that don't pass through the origin. Biases give the model more flexibility to fit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computation Graph**: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) that PyTorch builds to track operations performed on tensors with `requires_grad=True`. Each node represents an operation, and edges represent data flow. This graph enables automatic differentiation by recording the sequence of operations needed to compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Device Management**: The practice of controlling whether tensors and models run on CPU or GPU. GPUs provide 10-100x speedups for deep learning workloads through massive parallelization. PyTorch requires all tensors in an operation to be on the same device.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension Arguments**: Parameters (like `dim` or `axis`) that specify which dimension of a tensor an operation should work along. For example, `tensor.sum(dim=0)` sums along dimension 0 (rows), while `tensor.sum(dim=1)` sums along dimension 1 (columns). Understanding dimensions is crucial for correct tensor operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropout**: A regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neuron outputs to zero during training. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn robust features that don't rely on specific neurons. Dropout is disabled during evaluation using `model.eval()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding**: A learnable lookup table that converts discrete tokens (like words or IDs) into continuous vector representations. Embeddings allow neural networks to process categorical data by mapping each category to a dense vector. The embedding vectors are learned during training to capture semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epochs**: Complete passes through the entire training dataset. Training typically involves multiple epochs, allowing the model to see each example multiple times. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that balances training time with model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feed-Forward Networks**: Neural network architectures where information flows in one direction from input to output, without cycles. Also called Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), these networks consist of layers of neurons where each layer's output becomes the next layer's input. They're the foundation for more complex architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Pass**: The process of computing a neural network's output by passing input data through the network's layers sequentially. During the forward pass, each layer applies its transformation (weights, biases, activations) to produce outputs. This is the inference or prediction phase of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GeLU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)**: A smooth activation function that approximates `x * Φ(x)` where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. GeLU is used in modern architectures like BERT and GPT because it provides smoother gradients than ReLU. Unlike ReLU, GeLU allows small negative values to pass through.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Attributes**: The `.grad` attribute of a tensor that stores computed gradients after calling `.backward()`. Gradients indicate how much changing each parameter would affect the loss. Gradients accumulate by default, so they must be zeroed before each training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts parameters in the direction that reduces the loss. The algorithm computes gradients (slopes) of the loss with respect to parameters, then updates parameters by moving in the opposite direction. The learning rate controls the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LayerNorm (Layer Normalization)**: A normalization technique that standardizes activations across features for each sample independently. LayerNorm improves training stability and speed by keeping activations in a reasonable range. It's particularly effective in recurrent and transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that controls how much to adjust parameters during each optimization step. A learning rate that's too high causes unstable training, while one that's too low makes training extremely slow. Finding the right learning rate is crucial for successful training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression**: A simple model that learns a linear relationship between inputs and outputs: `y = Wx + b`. Despite its simplicity, linear regression demonstrates all the key concepts of neural network training: forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, and parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logits**: Raw, unnormalized scores output by a model before applying an activation function like softmax. In classification, logits represent the model's confidence for each class before conversion to probabilities. Many loss functions (like CrossEntropyLoss) expect logits rather than probabilities for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Functions**: Functions that measure how far a model's predictions are from the true values. The loss provides a single number that the optimizer tries to minimize. Common examples include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and Cross-Entropy for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**loss.backward()**: The method call that triggers backpropagation, computing gradients for all parameters with `requires_grad=True`. This method traverses the computation graph backward, applying the chain rule to calculate how each parameter affects the loss. After calling `loss.backward()`, gradients are stored in each parameter's `.grad` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Multiplication**: A fundamental linear algebra operation that combines two matrices to produce a new matrix. In PyTorch, matrix multiplication can be performed using `torch.mm()`, `torch.matmul()`, or the `@` operator. This operation is the core computation in neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**nn.Module**: The base class for all neural network components in PyTorch. Subclassing `nn.Module` provides automatic parameter tracking, device management, and train/eval mode switching. Every custom layer or model should inherit from `nn.Module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**optimizer.step()**: The method that updates model parameters using computed gradients. After calling `loss.backward()` to compute gradients, `optimizer.step()` applies the optimization algorithm (like SGD or Adam) to adjust parameters in the direction that reduces loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**optimizer.zero_grad()**: The method that clears (zeros out) all parameter gradients. This must be called before each backward pass because PyTorch accumulates gradients by default. Without zeroing gradients, new gradients would add to old ones, causing incorrect updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Learnable tensors in a neural network that are adjusted during training. Parameters are typically weights and biases in layers. PyTorch's `nn.Parameter` class marks tensors as learnable and ensures they're tracked by the module and optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduction Operations**: Operations that reduce tensor dimensions by aggregating values, such as sum, mean, max, or min. Reductions can operate across all elements or along specific dimensions. These operations are essential for computing losses, metrics, and pooling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: The most common activation function, defined as `max(0, x)`. ReLU outputs the input if positive, otherwise outputs zero. It's popular because it's computationally efficient, helps avoid vanishing gradients, and works well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**requires_grad**: A boolean flag on tensors that tells PyTorch whether to track operations for automatic differentiation. When `requires_grad=True`, PyTorch builds a computation graph to enable gradient computation. Model parameters have `requires_grad=True` by default, while input data typically doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape**: The dimensions of a tensor, describing how many elements it has along each axis. Shape is accessed via `.shape` or `.size()` and is crucial for ensuring operations have compatible dimensions. Common shapes include 1D vectors, 2D matrices, 3D sequences, and 4D image batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Softmax**: An activation function that converts a vector of logits into a probability distribution. Softmax ensures outputs are positive and sum to 1, making them interpretable as probabilities. It's commonly used as the final layer in classification networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**torch.gather**: An advanced indexing operation that selects elements from a tensor based on indices. Gather is useful for selecting specific elements along a dimension, such as extracting predicted class scores. It's commonly used in reinforcement learning and sequence modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**torch.tensor**: The fundamental data structure in PyTorch - a multi-dimensional array that can hold numbers. Tensors are similar to NumPy arrays but can run on GPUs and support automatic differentiation. All data in PyTorch (inputs, outputs, parameters) is represented as tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Loop**: The complete workflow for training a neural network, typically consisting of: iterate over epochs, iterate over batches, forward pass, compute loss, backward pass (compute gradients), optimizer step (update parameters), and zero gradients. This loop is repeated until the model converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weights**: The learnable parameters in neural network layers that determine connection strengths between neurons. In a linear layer computing `y = Wx + b`, W is the weight matrix. During training, weights are adjusted to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Y-hat (ŷ)**: Mathematical notation for predicted values output by a model, as opposed to true values (y). The difference between y-hat and y is the prediction error, which the loss function quantifies. The goal of training is to make y-hat as close to y as possible.\n",
